### What has been updated?
- now compatible with GS and NFP
- needs both DLC R&F and GS
- StatusMessages have been moved to notifications (NOTIFICATION_USER_DEFINED_7)

### What has been tested?
- Mother of Liberty: burst of faith
- Mother of Liberty: policy card unlocking
- Abolition: era scores from removing builders
- Artisan of Abolition: pillaging a tile with a luxury resource grants a free builder

### What has NOT been tested?
- AI/computer playing haiti
- multiplayer

### Known problems
- the icons (and their sounds) for notifications of type USER_DEFINED_X are not consistent and can even change during the game!
- the ethnicity for the civilization is set to "ETHNICITY_AFRICAN" - just like in the original mod. Not sure why, but this is only working for the icons/avatars but not for the actual units on the ground.
